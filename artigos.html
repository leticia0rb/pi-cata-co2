                                The biggest industrial plant yet to suck tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide out of the air came online yesterday in southwest Iceland. Direct air capture plants like this one have been hyped up lately by world leaders and giant corporations — notably Microsoft — that are looking to erase their legacy of greenhouse gas pollution. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This particular operation is ideally located to test the emerging technology. The new plant, built by Swiss company Climeworks, is powered by renewable energy from a geothermal power plant nearby. Climeworks also plans to lock the captured CO2 away in basalt rock formations just three kilometers from the geothermal plant. It’s a storage plan that likely bypasses the need for controversial new carbon dioxide pipelines.

                            “It’s going to be, I think, an interesting test case,” says David Morrow, director of research at the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University. “But it’s also sort of a baby step in the big scheme of things.”

                        Climeworks’ new direct air capture plant, called Orca for the Icelandic word for energy, will be able to draw down 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. That’s about how much 790 passenger vehicles might pump out in a year — not a huge amount, even though it’s the largest operation of its kind in the world. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The new plant is surprisingly compact. Imagine a shipping container that’s open on one side to reveal twelve giant fans. The plant is basically just eight of those containers, stacked two by two.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Climeworks uses a method called solid direct air capture to trap CO2. Here’s how it works: The fans suck in air. The air passes over a special solid sorbent filter that traps the carbon dioxide. Climeworks wouldn’t get into too much detail about how its filters work in an interview with The Verge, other than saying that it uses a base to attract CO2, which is mildly acidic. When the filter is fully saturated, it’s time for step two in the process. The unit heats up the filter to about 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), which releases the trapped carbon dioxide. <a href="#up">^</a>

                            ‘Orca’ will use geothermal energy to pull thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and pump it underground.                    </p>
                        <p>
                            The world's largest carbon capture plant has come online in Iceland, as entrepreneurs and environmentalists seek to build momentum for technology they see as key to fighting the increasingly dire threat of climate change.

                            Orca will be able to capture the equivalent of the annual emissions made by 790 cars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Named "Orca," the facility is located on a lava plateau in southwest Iceland, reports Michael Birnbaum for the Washington Post. Using a system of fans, filters and heaters and powered by a nearby geothermal power plant, it has the capacity to pull 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air each year and pump it into underground caverns where the gas, mixed with water, will slowly become stone as it cools.

                        the company behind Orca. “This plant that we have here is really the blueprint to further scale up and really industrialize.” 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Climeworks opened the world's first commercial carbon capture facility in Switzerland in 2017. That original plant has the ability to capture roughly 900 tons of carbon dioxide per year, and uses the captured gas in greenhouses and sells it to carbonated beverage producers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The construction of Orca single-handedly increases Earth's annual carbon capture capacity by 40 percent to 13,000 metric tons, reports Corbin Hiar of E&E News, but that is a small fraction of what will be needed to significantly reverse humanity's carbon emissions. Around 31.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide were emitted in 2020, reports Nikolaj Skydsgaard of Reuters. Orca will be able to capture the equivalent of the annual emissions made by 790 cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We need to turn this into a Starbucks, circa 1999, where you see one on every corner,” engineering researcher Peter Psarras told Hiar. “I think this is the future we might see in the next decade.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Climeworks founders hope to be able to remove 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the end of this decade, reports Ragnhildur Sigurdardottir and Akshat Rathi of Bloomberg Green. They already have plans to build a plant ten times larger than Orca within three years—and other companies aren't far behind, reports Molly Taft of Gizmodo. A plant due in Scotland by 2026 will capture between 500,000 and 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, while a planned facility in Texas will capture up to 1 million metric tons per year and use it help pump oil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Orca's method of carbon capture, called "direct air capture," is a relatively new technique, which uses chemical reactions to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, reports Audrey Carleton for Motherboard. The method contrasts with the more commonly used technologies that capture carbon emissions directly at their sources. It's also currently incredibly expensive, with a price tag of roughly $600 to $800 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, the Post reports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Direct air capture's high costs, relative lack of track record, and energy requirements have made it a controversial proposition among environmentalists, Motherboard reports. This year, hundreds of environmental groups signed an open letter to leaders in the American and Canadian governments arguing that carbon capture is not a solution to climate change because it gives cover to fossil fuel companies, among other reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “National strategies should focus on eliminating the use of fossil fuels and other combustible sources in our energy system, not simply reducing their emissions intensity," the groups wrote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nonetheless, many scientists remain optimistic, per Gizmodo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Orca is still small compared to the scale of the challenge, but it’s an important step in the right direction," carbon removal expert David Morrow of American University tells Gizmodo. <a href="#up">^</a>

                            As baleias são conhecidas por serem o maior e mais inteligente animal nos oceanos, mas também podem capturar toneladas de dióxido de carbono, CO2, uma função com um valor econômico de US$ 1 trilhão.                    </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive; color: #6B9080; font-size: xx-large;">
                            Biólogos marinhos descobriram que baleias capturam carbono da atmosfera.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A conclusão faz parte de um relatório do Fundo Monetário Internacional, FMI, publicado esta semana.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            O relatório afirma que “o potencial de captura de carbono das baleias é surpreendente.” Estes mamíferos acumulam carbono nos seus corpos quando estão vivos. Quando morrem, as baleias afundam no oceano, levando o carbono com elas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Segundo o estudo, cada animal capta, em média, cerca de 33 toneladas de dióxido de carbono. Em comparação, durante o mesmo período, uma árvore apenas absorve 3% desse valor. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As estimativas do relatório colocam o valor de uma baleia de tamanho médio, devido às suas diversas atividades, em mais de US$ 2 milhões. A quantidade atual de baleias representa um valor de mais de US$ 1 trilhão.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A base de alimentação de muitas baleias é o plâncton, pequenos organismos aquáticos que fazem fotossíntese e flutuam na água.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Esses seres produzem, pelo menos, metade de todo o oxigênio presente na atmosfera. Eles também capturam cerca de 37 bilhões de toneladas de CO2, o equivalente a quatro florestas da Amazônia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As fezes das baleias multiplicam a quantidade de plâncton, pois contêm ferro e nitrogênio que estes organismos precisam para crescer. Isso significa que, quanto mais baleias, mais oxigênio no planeta.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Em nota, a especialista em vida selvagem da ONU Meio Ambiente, Doreen Robinson, disse que o relatório “mostra claramente as ligações incríveis entre alguns dos maiores e menores seres vivos do planeta.”

                            Nesse momento, existem pouco mais de 1,3 milhão de baleias no oceano, cerca de 25% do número que havia antes do início da sua captura para fins comerciais, quando entre 4 a 5 milhões desses animais viviam nos oceanos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A situação é pior em algumas espécies, como a baleia-azul, a maior de todas elas, que tem apenas 3% do número de exemplares que costumava ter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Segundo a ONU Meio Ambiente, esses animais podem ser protegidos com programas semelhantes aos usados na promoção de florestas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            O relatório do FMI afirma que "podem ser criados mecanismos financeiros para promover a restauração das populações de baleias do mundo." Por exemplo, as empresas de transporte marítimo poderiam ser compensadas para usar rotas que reduzem o risco de colisões.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sem medidas adicionais, serão necessários mais de 30 anos para dobrar o número de baleias atuais e várias gerações para atingir o número original, antes destes animais começarem a ser caçados.

                            When it comes to climate change and global heating, we’re all on board with a global shift towards clean, renewable energy. We’re also all behind protecting rainforests and planting more trees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem is that these solutions will take time – decades – to reach the scale and efficacy needed to combat climate change and stop global heating.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We simply do not have decades and we need to stem the flow of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere before we reach the rapidly approaching threshold at which we can’t turn back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, what is the solution? Carbon capture companies are leading the way in the race against climate change and global heating.

                        <p>
                            They’re developing and deploying new, scalable, carbon capture technology that will enable us to stop the flow of carbon into the atmosphere and even remove the historical carbon dioxide that we’ve already emitted.

                        Today, we’re looking at carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology and seven of the best carbon capture companies that are leading the way towards achieving our climate goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s dive right in!
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive; color: #6B9080; font-size: x-large;">
                        What is Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), also referred to simply as ‘carbon capture’, is the process we can use to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at their source and prevent them from being released into the atmosphere.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CCUS involves capturing carbon, processing it into a suitable form, and then either transporting it for re-use or transferring it to suitable underground storage or sequestration sites. These sites vary and different technologies use different types of geologic formations as storage sites.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common types include oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams that are unsuitable for mining, and deep saline reservoirs. The structures used to store carbon underground are the same ones that have naturally stored carbon, crude oil, natural gas, and other substances for millions of years.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carbon storage is a safe and permanent solution, which removes carbon from the atmosphere and negates the greenhouse gas effect that drives global heating and climate change.                
                    </p>

                        7 Leading Carbon Capture Companies
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These carbon capture companies are championing the fight to reduce carbon emissions from current sources of emissions, and combat the problem of historical carbon emissions that are already in our atmosphere.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s look at them in more detail:                
                    </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Carbfix</li>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="https://www.carbfix.com/">Carbfix</a> is based in Iceland, where they have been an operation at the Hellisheiði Power Plant since 2014. In 2019, they were established as a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy (OR) and have been operating as a separate entity since January 2020.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their mission is to become a “key instrument in tackling the climate crisis by reaching one billion tons of permanently stored CO2 (1 GtCO2) as rapidly as possible”.                            
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carbfix captures carbon emissions at the source from the emitter (power plant or other industry). Carbon is then dissolved in water and injected underground, into naturally occurring reactive rock formations of suitable composition (basalt).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here, the carbon reacts with elements that are naturally present to form stable minerals. These stable minerals provide a permanent carbon sink and over time they turn to stone.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This process was thought to take hundreds of years to occur, however, the Carbfix pilot project undertaken in 2012 showed that they were able to achieve the desired result within two years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This makes their technology unique and highly effective in capturing carbon and storing it in a safe, stable, and permanent manner.
                                </p>
                            
                            <li>Global Thermostat</li>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="https://globalthermostat.com/">Global Thermostat</a> was established in the US in 2010. Their patented technology captures and concentrates carbon directly from the atmosphere and/or from industrial emissions. It can then be sold to various industries that can re-use it in their manufacturing processes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This approach makes carbon capture a profitable endeavor, rather than a financial liability for the emitting body. It also makes it a potential business operation for those who wish to capture atmospheric carbon and sell it to industries that need it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their modular system allows for individual plants to be erected in any location, without the geological limitations that carbon storage technologies face.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    According to their website, Global Thermostat uses specialized equipment proprietary amine-based (dry) chemical ‘sorbents’, which are bonded to honeycomb ceramic ‘monoliths’.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The ceramic monoliths, coated with the dry amine-based sorbents soak up or absorb carbon from the surrounding atmosphere. This may be directly from open-air or concentrated emission sites like flues or smokestacks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They then strip the carbon back out of the monoliths and collect it using low-temperature steam (85-100C). This results in 98% pure carbon, which can be transferred to locations where it is needed by other industries.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ideally, the steam used is generated by residual or process heat from the operation of the site where carbon is being collected, which means that no new energy is required for the process and reduces the cost of operation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As a modular system, their technology can be established alongside new and existing plants or industries that are heavy carbon emitters or alongside plants that need the captured carbon for their operations. This reduces the need for pipelines and reduces the risk of leakage, as well as the cost of implementation and operation.

                                    <a href="https://co2solutions.com/en/">CO2 Solutions by SAIPEM</a> is based in Quebec, Canada. They were established in 1997 and have since developed a unique carbon capture technology that was inspired by the human lung.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their technology uses an industrial form of the natural enzyme called carbonic anhydrase (CA), which is present in all animals and plants. The enzyme is what allows us to breathe, by managing the carbon we breathe in.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over the last 20 years, they have perfected and patented their technology to allow for up to 99.95% of carbon to the captured from industrial smokestacks and power plant emissions. The carbon is then transferred to nearby operations that need carbon, such as agricultural greenhouses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    According to their website, CO2 Solution’s carbon capture process uses a patented “industrial form of carbonic anhydrase, a natural enzyme that enables respiratory carbon management in all living organisms”.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their technology allows for carbon to be captured from installations or sites that produce it as a waste product and then re-used or converted in the industries that need it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Operations that need carbon to operate but also produce carbon emissions can use the technology to capture their own emissions and then re-use the carbon, which eliminates their greenhouse gas emissions and saves money in the process. The technology is efficient, economical, and produces no toxic waste or emissions.
                                </p>

                            <li>Net Power</li>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="https://netpower.com/">Net Power</a> is based in Durham, North Carolina in the United States. Their technology development began in 2008 as an exercise in developing low-cost power that did not produce any carbon emissions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They developed a new power cycle called the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle and from that NET Power was born in 2010. NET Power aims to meet all 2050 power goals with natural gas power plants that are semi-closed loop and CO2-powered with the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    NET Power’s electricity is generated by burning natural gas in the presence of pure oxygen, rather than air. This is more efficient and eliminates nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from the process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The carbon that is released from the burning of the natural gas is then recycled through a series of steps that heat, cool, and compress it to result in low-cost and emission-free electricity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carbon can then be recycled back into the plant for use and excess can be piped away for re-use by other industries. This adds financial incentive to use the method, in addition to the inherent low-cost production model.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Where there are no local industries that require carbon, the excess can be safely sequestered underground
                                </p>

                            <li>Quest Carbon Capture and Storage by Shell </li>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="https://www.shell.ca/en_ca/about-us/projects-and-sites/quest-carbon-capture-and-storage-project.html">Quest</a> is Shell’s carbon capture plant at their Scotford Upgrader power plant in Alberta, Canada. It is run and owned by Shell, who use it to remove the carbon they generate at the power plant converting bitumen from sand into oil.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The carbon is then piped to a separate location and injected 2km underground into permeable geologic formations where it stays permanently.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Quest is in use at Shell’s plant called the Scotford Upgrader, where they make crude oil from the bitumen found in sand. The oil-making process requires hydrogen to make the oil lighter but with this comes carbon dioxide emissions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To combat this, Shell installed Quest to capture the carbon and pipe it away in liquid form to the injected and stored underground.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Quest’s technology is fairly simple and uses an amine to absorb carbon. The carbon is then separated from the amine and compressed. This turns the CO2 gas into a liquid, which is then piped away to be injected into porous underground rock formations.

                                    The liquid CO2 is piped 65km away from the plant through various well sites and then injected over 2km underground, unto suitable porous rock formations. Here, it will remain for thousands of years and is considered a permanent solution.

                                    <a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a> is a carbon capture company based in Zurich, Switzerland, and was established in 2009. However, their technology has been in development since 2007.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Climeworks is the largest company offering carbon capture services that capture carbon directly from the air and they’re currently building a new direct air capture plant called Orca in Iceland.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They’re using their own technology to capture CO2 and then using Carbfix’s technology for underground storage. The plant aims to capture 4000 tons of CO₂ per year – making it the world’s biggest climate-positive facility to date. In addition to Orca, they have over 6500 smaller plants in operation with various partners.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Climeworks uses modular CO2 collectors that capture carbon dioxide directly from the air to remove unavoidable CO2 emissions, as well as historic CO₂ emissions. The collectors can be stacked to create machines of various sizes, as suited to the location and end-use of the carbon collected.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Climeworks’ carbon collectors use a two-step process, where the air is drawn into the collector by a fan, where it is collected on the surface of a special filter material that is inside the collector. The next step takes place when the filter is full and the collector closes. Once it is closed, the temperature is raised to 80-100C, which releases the carbon. It is then collected in its pure and highly concentrated form, ready to be piped away for re-use or underground storage.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Orca plant in Iceland uses the storage technology by Carbfix, where CO2 is mixed with water and injected into basalt rock formations. There is mineralizes and forms rock, locking the carbon in place, within a few years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Climeworks collectors are powered using renewable energy or energy-from-waste. Their grey emission is under 10%, which is a very low level of re-emission.

                                    <a href="https://carbonengineering.com/">Carbon Engineering</a> was established in 2009, in Calgary, Canada. They moved to Squamish in 2015, where they built their pilot plant to capture carbon directly from the atmosphere and either store it safely underground or convert it to synthetic fuel.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carbon Engineering has since partnered with companies in the US and the UK to collect and sequester atmospheric carbon, as well as companies around the world to produce clean fuel from the carbon they collect.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carbon Engineering uses an air contactor, where the air is pulled in by a huge fan and passes over thin plastic structures that are coated in a potassium hydroxide solution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This solution removes carbon from the air and binds the carbon into a liquid solution, where it remains as a carbonate salt. The air is then released, minus the carbon.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The solution containing the carbonate salt is then run through a series of chemical processes that purify it, concentrate it, and compress it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carbonate salts are separated from the solution into pellets, which are then heated in a calciner to release a pure carbon gas that can be reused or stored underground.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The remaining pellets are then hydrated and recycled back into the system to make the original capture chemical.
                                </p>

                        Final Thoughts
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, some great carbon capture companies are doing great work to prevent current carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere, as well as removing unavoidable and historic carbon directly from the air.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While eliminating carbon emissions by replacing emitting activities with renewable energy technology is the ideal solution, it will take decades to achieve. Decades that we do not have in the race against global heating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carbon capture and storage is a viable and essential solution to combat historical emissions and stem the flow of current emissions, as we prepare ourselves to move over to renewables and scale those operations to meet an ever-increasing global demand for energy. <a href="#up">^</a>
